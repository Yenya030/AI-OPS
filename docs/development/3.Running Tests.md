# Running Tests

AI-OPS uses a small test suite that depends on a running [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) server and a Qdrant instance. The repository provides a helper script to reproduce the CI environment locally.

```bash
./scripts/run_tests_with_ollama.sh
```

The script installs the required Python packages, starts Qdrant and Ollama, pulls the models used during testing, and finally executes `pytest`. Set the `ENDPOINT` environment variable if your Ollama instance is listening on a different host or port.
